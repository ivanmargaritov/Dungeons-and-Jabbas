This is the final Clean Code Course project. 
It is a simple 2D game, where one hero fights with many creatures in a map. The hero can obtain 
different treasures - weapons, spells, health potions, mana potions. The hero moves through a 
special dungeon. The hero wins if he gets out of the dungeon alive.
